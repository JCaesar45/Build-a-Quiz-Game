# Quiz Game

A simple JavaScript-based quiz game where a computer randomly selects a question, chooses an answer, and the result is displayed based on correctness.

## Features

- A set of 5+ multiple-choice questions from various categories
- Random question selection
- Random computer answer generation
- Automatic correctness check
- Easy to expand or customize

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (optional for running in terminal)

## How It Works

1. A question is randomly selected from a predefined array.
2. The computer randomly chooses one of the answer choices.
3. The program checks if the computer's answer matches the correct answer.
4. A result message is displayed indicating whether the choice was correct or not.

## Code Overview

### 1. `questions` Array

Each question object includes:

- `category`: The topic of the question.
- `question`: The question text.
- `choices`: An array of three possible answers.
- `answer`: The correct answer (always included in `choices`).

```js
const questions = [
  {
    category: "Science",
    question: "What is the chemical symbol for water?",
    choices: ["H2O", "CO2", "O2"],
    answer: "H2O"
  },
  ...
];
```

### 2. `getRandomQuestion(questionsArray)`

Returns a random question from the array.

```js
function getRandomQuestion(questionsArray) {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * questionsArray.length);
  return questionsArray[randomIndex];
}
``

### 3. `getRandomComputerChoice(choicesArray)`

Returns a random choice from the questionâ€™s answer choices.

```js
function getRandomComputerChoice(choicesArray) {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * choicesArray.length);
  return choicesArray[randomIndex];
}
``

### 4. `getResults(questionObject, computerChoice)`

Checks if the computer's choice is correct and returns the result message.

```js
function getResults(questionObject, computerChoice) {
  if (computerChoice === questionObject.answer) {
    return "The computer's choice is correct!";
  } else {
    return `The computer's choice is wrong. The correct answer is: ${questionObject.answer}`;
  }
}
``

## Sample Usage

```js
const question = getRandomQuestion(questions);
const computerChoice = getRandomComputerChoice(question.choices);
console.log("Question:", question.question);
console.log("Computer's Answer:", computerChoice);
console.log(getResults(question, computerChoice));
``

## How to Run

1. Copy the code into a `.js` file (e.g., `quizGame.js`)
2. Run using Node.js:

```bash
node quizGame.js
``

Or embed it in an HTML file and run in the browser console.
